# Smart Delivery Optimization

## Introduction

In many urban areas, delivery services typically assign one delivery person per order. While this approach is straightforward, it often leads to high operational costs and inefficiencies, especially at scale.

This project proposes a smarter, more cost-effective solution by strategically positioning specialized warehouses across the city. By dividing the city into multiple zones and establishing key warehouse hubs within these zones, we aim to optimize the flow of deliveries.

Instead of transporting packages directly from the source to the final destination, items will be routed through a network of intermediate warehouses. This approach enables delivery personnel to consolidate multiple packages into a single trip by implementing a pooling strategy.

The result is significant cost reduction and improved operational efficiency.
